This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

If the app is calling an API running locally, disable CORS with a browser extension.

## Deployment

Deployed on Netlify using Sunny65 branch
Currently not working because API deployed on digital ocean is "loading mixed active content"... I think because API is http and netlify is HTTPS
